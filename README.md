Predictive Sports Analytics using ETL and Machine Learning

Project Overview

This project focuses on creating an advanced ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to gather historical data on teams and players from various online sources. Utilizing Python's powerful web scraping tools, the data is meticulously extracted and then organized and categorized using Pandas and NumPy. The core of this project lies in running this rich dataset through Neural Networks (NN) using TensorFlow and scikit-learn. The goal is to develop a predictive model that outperforms sportsbooks' predictions in forecasting game outcomes.

Why This Project?

Traditional sportsbooks often base their predictions on minimizing exposure to risk, which can overlook certain variables and nuances. Our model aims to exploit this gap by accounting for natural human biases and a broader range of statistical data, enhancing the accuracy of game outcome predictions.
